## Tools

This site uses the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) system for blogs. This software generates a static website from the source files. A set of tools is available to transform the sources into html-files: MarkDown (simple makeup), Liquid (template engine), and others. From the description:

> Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.

On top op Jekyll, two extensions are used:

* [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) 
* [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) (provides a.o. the navigation menu and the corresponding color schemes)

Most of the code of these extensions is found in the corresponding css-files.

Poole and Lanyon are distributed under the MIT license
